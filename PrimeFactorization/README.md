# Prime Factorization
In the Mathematical Cryptography one of the most Important theorem is that every positive integer has an essentially unique factorization as a product of primes .
### Theorem (The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic).
let a >= 2 be an integer. Then a can be factored as a product of prime numbers\

Further, other than rearranging the order of the primes, this factorization into prime powers is unique.
