# Prime Factorization
In the Mathematical Cryptography one of the most Important theorem is that every positive integer has an essentially unique factorization as a product of primes .
### Theorem (The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic).
	> let a >= 2 be an integer. Then a can be factored as a product of prime numbers
		> a = p(1)^e(1) . p(2)^e(2) . p(3)^e(3) ... p(r)^e(r)
	> Further, other than rearranging the order of the primes, this factorization into prime powers is unique.
