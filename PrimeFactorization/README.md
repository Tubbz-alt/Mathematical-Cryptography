# Prime Factorization
In the Mathematical Cryptography one of the most Important theorem is that every positive integer has an essentially unique factorization as a product of primes.

### Implementation
We need to implement theorem for use its application in the **Mathematical cryptography** , so we need to find efficient algortihm for finding the prime fators of integers number.
unfortunately we dont have any efficient algorithm for solve the problem in the old computing but with the **Quantum Computing** we able to solve it prefectly , but that need to we have Quantum computer :unamused: , we dont have that .
